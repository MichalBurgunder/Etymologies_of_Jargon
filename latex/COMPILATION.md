# Source Code Thesis

Saving the PDF in a GitHub repo is unprofessional, and reeks of laziness. Hence, why you can find the LaTex source code here. I'll try and upload the pdf on my website at a later time, although this will have to do for now. 

## Compiling the Thesis
Because the text includes many figures, you will need to generate these figures yourself via `analysis/main.py` and `visualization/main.py`, instead of me uploading a large amount of data to this repo. See section *Usage* in the `README.md` file.

Head on over to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), and paste the entire text of `main.tex` into a new document, and upload all generated figures, without renaming any of them. When you hit compile, the PDF should emerge exactly as it was handed it. There should be no problems downloading packages, as Overleaf should be able to do this on the fly for you.
