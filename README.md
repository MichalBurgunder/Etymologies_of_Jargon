# Onomastics of Software

This repository is published in conjunction with the hand-in of my Master's thesis "Onomastics of Software". It is primarily meant as an addtional source of information for the Master's committee, who are evaluating my handed in thesis (see (TODO: add final pdf here) for the full PDF of the file.). It's secondary use, is for any researchers who might be interested in either creating & analyzing their own data sets, or researchers who would like to build on on this thesis, to either perform more analyses, extend data sets, or use this repo for any other endeavor they might have.  

## Analyses

Max_depth: Computes the maximum depth of a tree
Ety_type 1: Creates a histogram of Ety. types by decade
Ety_type 2: Does the same thing as the above anaylsis, but instead, with the 2nd "Ety. Type" field

Max_volume: Computes the volume of a node

Compound-jargons: Computes the number of morphemes in a jargon
Number of Morphemes: Outputs simple bar graph that showcase the number of morphemes per name, per data set
Name length: Outputs simple bar graphs that showcase the number of characters per name, per data set


## Licence

All of this software and its data is licensed under the MIT licence. The reason for this, is that while I would like all applicaton to be open source as well (GPL), I'd more like for people to do whatever they want with the data provided. The study has (in a vague shape or form) been funded by the Universit√† della svizzera italiana (USI), a institution funded by the state, so the the products of the university ought to "belong" to the state, i.e. everyone in the country, and so, the world.
